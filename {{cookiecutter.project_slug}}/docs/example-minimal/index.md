Welcome to your documentation. This is a minimal starter template.

## Getting Started

Edit this file and the chapter files to create your documentation.

## Structure

This documentation uses:
- **Chapter numbering**: Files like `01-introduction.md` automatically get numbered
- **Interactive charts**: Use ECharts code blocks for visualizations
- **PDF export**: Generate professional PDFs with static chart images

## Next Steps

1. Customize the chapters below with your content
2. Add more chapters by creating files like `04-next-chapter.md`
3. See `docs/README.md` for detailed instructions
